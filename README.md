# CakePHP Facebook Application

This is my boilerplate Facbeook application, you should be able to clone it and be up and running straight away.

All configuration variables are set using Apache SetEnv and are n use in app/Config/bootstrap.php and app/Config/database.php

If you don't have access to the vhost file, simply replace the values in the files.

Authorising the app is enforced by default.
